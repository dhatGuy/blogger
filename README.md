In this project I created a simple blog system and learn the basics of Ruby on Rails including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
 *Data Structures & Relationships
 *Routing
 *Migrations
 *Views with forms, partials, and helpers
 *RESTful design
 *Adding gems for extra features

This project is based on the curriculum on [theOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com) with the tutorial from [Jumpstartlab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)
