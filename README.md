# Blogger 2

In this project I created a simple blog system and learn the basics of Ruby on Rails including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
* Data Structures & Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design
* Adding gems for extra features

This project is based on the curriculum on [theOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com) with the tutorial from [Jumpstartlab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)
